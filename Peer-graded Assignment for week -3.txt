/*
  Peer-graded Assignment for week-3
  Note:- I'm using NODE MCU esp8266
  Blink the blue LED on the ESP-01 module
  The blue LED on the ESP-01 module is connected to GPIO1
  (which is also the TXD pin; so we cannot use Serial.print() at the same time)
  Note that this sketch uses LED_BUILTIN to find the pin with the internal LED

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);     // Initialize the LED_BUILTIN pin as an output
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  // here I am using simple digitalWrite function and delay time function, You can assume that I don't know any loop function right-know
